# ⚡ MonitorIO

![](https://github.com/smo0ths/MonitorIO/blob/main/ss.png)

**MonitorIO** is a simple, no-frills utility for viewing real-time I/O activity on Windows. It shows which programs are reading from or writing to disk, how much data they’re moving, right now and bit of a snapshot in gray for later reference → all in a straightforward interface.

Whether you're troubleshooting a slow system, curious about background activity, or just want to see which apps are hitting your drives, MonitorIO gives you a clear snapshot of I/O behavior without the overhead of complex monitoring suites.
