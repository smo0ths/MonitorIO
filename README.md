# ⚡ MonitorIO

**MonitorIO** is a simple, no-frills utility for viewing real-time I/O activity on Windows. It shows which programs are reading from or writing to disk, how much data they’re moving, and when it’s happening — all in a straightforward interface.

Whether you're troubleshooting a slow system, curious about background activity, or just want to see which apps are hitting your drives, MonitorIO gives you a clear snapshot of I/O behavior without the overhead of complex monitoring suites.
